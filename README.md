# Python Code Examples for Bioinformatics

This repository contains a collection of code examplas demonstrating various bioinformatics tasks. Below is an overview of each script and its functionality.

## Scripts

### `check_coocurring_species.py`
Identifies and prints co-occurring organisms between two sets of FASTA sequences. Based on FASTA sequence IDs, it extracts species names and finds common organisms between two files.

### `genes_to_papers_UniProt.py`
Retrieves scientific papers data (title, abstract, and authors) linked to specified genes from UniProt, using a set of user-defined keywords (terms).

### `protein_taxa_assignment.py`
Assigns the order of taxonomy for each protein by searching inside a proteome file and assigning a proteome ID, which is transferred to a taxa name.

### `retrive_seqs_with_pattern.py`
Retrieves FASTA sequences from a given directory based on a given pattern.

## Usage

Please refer to the individual scripts for specific usage instructions. Most scripts can be run from the command line with the required input files and parameters.
