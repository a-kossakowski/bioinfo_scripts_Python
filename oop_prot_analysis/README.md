# Bioinformatics Protein Analysis Script

This repository contains the `OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py` script, which is designed for various protein analysis tasks using BioPython. It's an object-oriented approach to calculate molecular weight, isoelectric point, amino acid composition, and more.

## Features

- Molecular weight calculation
- Isoelectric point determination
- Amino acid composition analysis
- Domain search within the protein sequence
- Count of specific amino acids

## Setup

To run this script, you need to have Python installed along with the BioPython library. You can install BioPython using pip:

bash:
pip install biopython

## Usage
The OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py script can be executed as a standalone Python script. Simply clone this repository and run the script:

python OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py

## Testing
The test_OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py script is included to test the functionality of the Protein class within OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py. The tests are written using Python's unittest framework.

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory of this project:

python -m unittest test_OOP_BioPyth_prot_analysis.py


This will run a series of tests to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the Protein class's methods.
